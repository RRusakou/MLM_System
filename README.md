# MLM System 

This project is a MLM system with basic functionality.

It allows you to use the following functions:


1. First, you must register in the system. To do this, use the ```SignUp()``` function.
In case someone invited you, you can specify his address as a function parameter ```SignUp(address)```.

2. By registering in the system, a number of functions will become available to you: viewing the level( ```getLevel(address)``` ), viewing the balance( ```getBalance(address) ```), information about referrals( ```getReferralsInfo()```), it is possible to invest and withdraw money ( ```withdraw()``` ).
